practice</title><abstract>Crisis response engenders a high-stress environment in which teams gather, transform, and mutually share information. Prior educational approaches have not successfully addressed these critical skills. The assumption has been that the highest fidelity simulations result in the best learning. Deploying high-fidelity simulations is expensive and dangerous; they do not address team coordination. Low-fidelity approaches are ineffective because they are not stressful. Zero-fidelity simulation develops and invokes the principle of abstraction, focusing on human-information and human-human transfers of meaning, to derive design from work practice. Our principal hypothesis is that crisis responders will experience zero-fidelity simulation as effective simulation of team coordination. We synthesize the sustained iterative design and evaluation of the Team Coordination Game. We develop and apply new experimental methods to show that participants learn to cooperate and communicate, applying what they learn in practice.

abstract_field="ABSTRACT&#10;        &#10;&#10; &#10;Team coordination is essential for many critical tasks, but teaching people to work together is difficult. Vital to safety and security, the demanding team coordination of fire emergency response is characterized by real time stresses. Participants quickly acquire, integrate, and share large amounts of information while synchronizing action in dangerous, dynamic situations. Computer programming, another demanding task performed by teams, is vital to security and industry. Digital games are an exciting, new, intrinsically motivating medium of education, capable of requiring interpersonal communication and cooperation, and simulating stress in a safe environment. The embodied basis of location-aware games, which create mixed reality by combining direct physical action with human computer interaction via wearable computers and sensors, provides unique capabilities for human-to-human interaction. Location-aware multi-player games change the way participants interact with one another, by affording players the opportunity to spontaneously split-up and re-group, which is impossible in traditional desktop digital games. This research develops and evaluates a location-aware non-mimetic simulation game for teaching team coordination based on preliminary findings that establish the importance of dynamic re-grouping of participants and optimization of communication modalities, such as face-to-face and radio, in fire emergency response. The project introduces non-mimetic simulation to describe environments that model contextualized human task operations, emphasizing the structure of human communication and coordination, while abstracting out physical characteristics of an environment. Non-mimetic simulation focuses simulation resources on goal-directed operational characteristics of task performance, such as information flows. The objective of this proposal is to develop new high performance, cost-effective methods for using location-aware non-mimetic simulation games to teach team coordination for emergency response. Further, the transfer of the non-mimetic simulation from its roots in grounded ethnographic data about fire emergency response to teaching teams of STEM students to coordinate collaborative projects will be investigated. The principal hypotheses are to investigate whether and how location-aware games can improve team coordination performance in dangerous and stressful environments, and whether this method for teaching skills will prove transferable to other teamwork contexts.The proposed research is innovative in its interdisciplinary approach, which integrates methods from ethnography, distributed and team cognition, game design, location-aware systems, human computer interaction, and emergency response. This innovative approach is expected to yield significant outcomes: (1) a grounded methodology of non-mimetic simulation; (2) new knowledge of how embodied game play impacts education; (3) new non-mimetic simulation game design methods for teaching team coordination across domains; (4) new knowledge about designing and evaluating location-aware systems; (5) new methods for evaluating team coordination and how games support it. Research products will be deployed in the nation&#39;s largest fire training facility, which educates over 45,000 students per year, improving the skills and performance of emergency responders. More effective teamwork means that fire emergency responders will be better able to perform their duties: protecting the lives of citizens, protecting each others&#39; lives, and protecting property. Games are an essential form of culture. Delivering education through games will motivate student engagement. In a period in which STEM enrollment has been declining, deployment among undergraduate computer science majors is expected to increase retention." amount_string="$539806" award_instrument="Standard Grant" field_applications="0116000    Human Subjects" initial_amendment_date="Thu Jul 17 00:00:00 PDT 2008" latest_amendment_date="Mon May 07 00:00:00 PDT 2012" program_reference_codes="HPCC, 9251, 9215, 7924, 7367" simpl:id="20289731"><title>HCC - Medium: A Location-Aware Non-Mimetic Simulation Game for Teaching Team Coordination</title><clippings><text_clipping context="HCC - Medium: A Location-Aware Non-Mimetic Simulation Game for Teaching Team Coordination" text="HCC - Medium: A Location-Aware Non-Mimetic Simulation Game for Teaching Team Coordination"><source_doc><nsf_award simpl:ref="20289731"/></source_doc></text_clipping></clippings><investigators><investigator mm_name="authors" location="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/piSearch.do?SearchType=piSearch&amp;page=1&amp;QueryText=&amp;IncludeCOPI=true&amp;PIInstitution=&amp;PIState=&amp;PIZip=&amp;PICountry=&amp;Restriction=0&amp;Search=Search&amp;PIFirstName=Andruid&amp;PILastName=Kerne" email="andruid@cs.tamu.edu" investigation_type="(Principal Investigator)" first_name="Andruid" last_name="Kerne"><title>Andruid Kerne</title></investigator></investigators><programs><grant_program mm_name="programs" location="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/afSearch.do?ExpDateOperator=&amp;PIFirstName=&amp;PICountry=&amp;Search=Search&amp;PIZip=&amp;Restriction=0&amp;StartDateFrom=&amp;StartDateOperator=&amp;page=4&amp;OriginalAwardDateFrom=&amp;ProgProgram=&amp;AwardAmount=&amp;ProgFoaCode=&amp;AwardNumberTo=&amp;ExpDateFrom=&amp;AwardNumberFrom=&amp;OriginalAwardDateTo=&amp;AwardInstrument=&amp;ExpDateTo=&amp;StartDateTo=&amp;ProgEleCode=7367&amp;PIInstitution=&amp;PILastName=&amp;OriginalAwardDateOperator=&amp;BooleanRef=false&amp;AwardNumberOperator=&amp;ProgOrganization=&amp;SearchType=afSearch&amp;BooleanElement=false&amp;ProgRefCode=&amp;QueryText=&amp;ProgOfficer=&amp;PIState="><title>HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING</title><additional_locations><location>http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/afSearch.do?SearchType=afSearch&amp;page=4&amp;QueryText=&amp;PIFirstName=&amp;PILastName=&amp;PIInstitution=&amp;PIState=&amp;PIZip=&amp;PICountry=&amp;ProgOrganization=&amp;ProgOfficer=&amp;ProgEleCode=0&amp;BooleanElement=false&amp;ProgRefCode=&amp;BooleanRef=false&amp;ProgProgram=&amp;ProgFoaCode=&amp;OriginalAwardDateOperator=&amp;OriginalAwardDateFrom=&amp;OriginalAwardDateTo=&amp;StartDateOperator=&amp;StartDateFrom=&amp;StartDateTo=&amp;ExpDateOperator=&amp;ExpDateFrom=&amp;ExpDateTo=&amp;AwardNumberOperator=&amp;AwardNumberFrom=&amp;AwardNumberTo=&amp;AwardAmount=&amp;AwardInstrument=&amp;Restriction=0&amp;Search=Search</location></additional_locations></grant_program></programs><managers><manager mm_name="managers" location="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/afSearch.do?SearchType=afSearch&amp;page=4&amp;QueryText=&amp;PIFirstName=&amp;PILastName=&amp;PIInstitution=&amp;PIState=&amp;PIZip=&amp;PICountry=&amp;ProgOrganization=&amp;ProgEleCode=&amp;BooleanElement=false&amp;ProgRefCode=&amp;BooleanRef=false&amp;ProgProgram=&amp;ProgFoaCode=&amp;OriginalAwardDateOperator=&amp;OriginalAwardDateFrom=&amp;OriginalAwardDateTo=&amp;StartDateOperator=&amp;StartDateFrom=&amp;StartDateTo=&amp;ExpDateOperator=&amp;ExpDateFrom=&amp;ExpDateTo=&amp;AwardNumberOperator=&amp;AwardNumberFrom=&amp;AwardNumberTo=&amp;AwardAmount=&amp;AwardInstrument=&amp;Restriction=0&amp;Search=Search&amp;ProgOfficer=William+Bainbridge" affiliation="IIS Division of Information &amp; Intelligent Systems  CSE Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering"><title>William Bainbridge</title></manager></managers><sponsor mm_name="sponsor"><title>Texas Engineering Experiment Station                            &#10;TEES State Headquarters Bldg.   &#10;College Station, TX 77845 979/458-7617</title></sponsor><publications><publication mm_name="publications"><title>Pen-in-Hand Command: NUI for Real-Time Strategy eSports</title><authors><author mm_name="authors"><title>Hamilton, W.</title></author><author mm_name="authors"><title>Kerne, A.</title></author><author mm_name="authors"><title>Moeller, J.</title></author></authors><source mm_name="source" year="1455"><title>Proc CHI 2011 Extended, 2011, p. 1455.</title></source></publication><publication mm_name="publications"><title>Synchronized Communication and Coordinated Views: Qualitative Data Discovery for Team Game User Studies</title><authors><author mm_name="authors"><title>Hamilton, W.</title></author><author mm_name="authors"><title>Toups, Z.

This research supports people engaged in sustained information discovery tasks, such as invention and thesis development, in which the goal is to create new knowledge by forming ideas while finding and assembling information. New modalities of human computer interaction will be developed to support people engaged in assembling their building blocks of invention, utilizing information semantics, dynamic organization, and visualization. The approach is based on the form of composition, which visually and conceptually integrates elements to represent a collection. The research notebook will support sustained innovation, in which people need to connect and integrate key findings in the collections they create while conducting research and invention over time. Physically-based techniques, such as mass-spring and flocking models, will be applied and extended to facilitate human manipulation of collections as compositions. New modalities of interaction, such as pen-based, will improve sensory feedback and engagement by enabling participants to literally get their hands into digital information. The physically-based techniques and new interaction modalities will be integrated with the combinFormation mixed-initiative composition platform to provide a basis for augmenting the research notebook beyond the desktop metaphor.  Our principal hypothesis is that mixed-initiative composition and physically-based multimodal interaction will improve the emergence of new ideas during individual and team-based information discovery tasks. Using the research notebook on assignments by over 1,000 undergraduate students developing new inventions each year in The Design Process course will catalyze innovative education, while also generating evaluation data on information discovery.The proposed research is innovative in its interdisciplinary approach, expected to yield significant outcomes: (1)  new techniques for physically-based interaction with information; (2) new multimodal techniques for interaction with information; (3) new integrated semantic, visual, and interactive methods for supporting human discovery of connections among ideas; (4) a research notebook infrastructure for supporting sustained interaction with digital information by students and researchers; (5) new data about how students and researchers develop ideas over time in practice; (6) new understanding of creative processes that make up research and invention; and (7) new methods for supporting research and invention in education. Advanced learning technologies developed by this proposal will be implemented and distributed through the Research Notebook and the combinFormation platform. Software technologies will be made available to the students and the public through the web. A multimodal interaction lab will make integrated software/hardware systems available to some of the students. The Research Notebook methods, techniques, and cyberinfrastructure can amplify the productivity of scientists. The new interactive techniques for discovery and semantics can transform how students, researchers, knowledge workers, and the public experience the internet and digital repositories. The integration into education of research issues, designs, and implementations, with a learner-centered approach, will contribute to the development of a new generation of creativity-oriented human-centered computing researchers and practitioners." amount_string="$594000" award_instrument="Continuing grant" field_applications="0116000    Human Subjects" initial_amendment_date="Fri Mar 28 00:00:00 PDT 2008" latest_amendment_date="Wed Apr 25 00:00:00 PDT 2012" program_reference_codes="HPCC, 9251, 9215, 7367, 1707, 1187, 1045" simpl:id="8641249"><title>CAREER:   A Multimodal Mixed-Initiative Research Notebook for Information Discovery</title><clippings><text_clipping context="CAREER:   A Multimodal Mixed-Initiative Research Notebook for Information Discovery" text="CAREER:   A Multimodal Mixed-Initiative Research Notebook for Information Discovery"><source_doc><nsf_award simpl:ref="8641249"/></source_doc></text_clipping></clippings><investigators><investigator mm_name="authors" location="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/piSearch.do?SearchType=piSearch&amp;page=1&amp;QueryText=&amp;IncludeCOPI=true&amp;PIInstitution=&amp;PIState=&amp;PIZip=&amp;PICountry=&amp;Restriction=0&amp;Search=Search&amp;PIFirstName=Andruid&amp;PILastName=Kerne" email="andruid@cs.tamu.edu" investigation_type="(Principal Investigator)" first_name="Andruid" last_name="Kerne"><title>Andruid Kerne</title></investigator></investigators><programs><grant_program mm_name="programs" location="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/afSearch.do?ExpDateOperator=&amp;PIFirstName=&amp;PICountry=&amp;Search=Search&amp;PIZip=&amp;Restriction=0&amp;StartDateFrom=&amp;StartDateOperator=&amp;page=4&amp;OriginalAwardDateFrom=&amp;ProgProgram=&amp;AwardAmount=&amp;ProgFoaCode=&amp;AwardNumberTo=&amp;ExpDateFrom=&amp;AwardNumberFrom=&amp;OriginalAwardDateTo=&amp;AwardInstrument=&amp;ExpDateTo=&amp;StartDateTo=&amp;ProgEleCode=7367&amp;PIInstitution=&amp;PILastName=&amp;OriginalAwardDateOperator=&amp;BooleanRef=false&amp;AwardNumberOperator=&amp;ProgOrganization=&amp;SearchType=afSearch&amp;BooleanElement=false&amp;ProgRefCode=&amp;QueryText=&amp;ProgOfficer=&amp;PIState="><title>HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING</title><additional_locations><location>http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/afSearch.do?SearchType=afSearch&amp;page=4&amp;QueryText=&amp;PIFirstName=&amp;PILastName=&amp;PIInstitution=&amp;PIState=&amp;PIZip=&amp;PICountry=&amp;ProgOrganization=&amp;ProgOfficer=&amp;ProgEleCode=0&amp;BooleanElement=false&amp;ProgRefCode=&amp;BooleanRef=false&amp;ProgProgram=&amp;ProgFoaCode=&amp;OriginalAwardDateOperator=&amp;OriginalAwardDateFrom=&amp;OriginalAwardDateTo=&amp;StartDateOperator=&amp;StartDateFrom=&amp;StartDateTo=&amp;ExpDateOperator=&amp;ExpDateFrom=&amp;ExpDateTo=&amp;AwardNumberOperator=&amp;AwardNumberFrom=&amp;AwardNumberTo=&amp;AwardAmount=&amp;AwardInstrument=&amp;Restriction=0&amp;Search=Search</location></additional_locations></grant_program></programs><managers><manager mm_name="managers" location="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/afSearch.do?SearchType=afSearch&amp;page=4&amp;QueryText=&amp;PIFirstName=&amp;PILastName=&amp;PIInstitution=&amp;PIState=&amp;PIZip=&amp;PICountry=&amp;ProgOrganization=&amp;ProgEleCode=&amp;BooleanElement=false&amp;ProgRefCode=&amp;BooleanRef=false&amp;ProgProgram=&amp;ProgFoaCode=&amp;OriginalAwardDateOperator=&amp;OriginalAwardDateFrom=&amp;OriginalAwardDateTo=&amp;StartDateOperator=&amp;StartDateFrom=&amp;StartDateTo=&amp;ExpDateOperator=&amp;ExpDateFrom=&amp;ExpDateTo=&amp;AwardNumberOperator=&amp;AwardNumberFrom=&amp;AwardNumberTo=&amp;AwardAmount=&amp;AwardInstrument=&amp;Restriction=0&amp;Search=Search&amp;ProgOfficer=Ephraim+P.+Glinert" affiliation="IIS Division of Information &amp; Intelligent Systems  CSE Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering"><title>Ephraim P.

       &#10;&#10; &#10;In this Cyberlearning Design and Implementation Project, the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML) and a non-profit collaborator, Machine Science Inc. of Cambridge,Massachusetts, are studying classroom implementations of a web platform that helps middle school and high school teachers engage their students in collaborative scientific inquiry. This technology -- the Internet System for Networked Sensor Experimentation (iSENSE) -- provides a shared repository of user-contributed classroom activities, such as tabletop science experiments, environmental analyses, engineering projects, and surveys, together with the data generated by these activities. The system features tools that enable teachers and students to create their own experiments, upload and tag data, and configure and share dynamic visual representations of the data.School districts in Massachusetts and New Hampshire are participating in the four-year study. Teachers from each district attend annual summer professional development workshops at UML and receive ongoing support from the project team in integrating iSENSE into their science teaching. Educators participate in follow-up meetings during the academic year to report their experiences and exchange best practices. The most promising approaches are documented as lesson plans and shared with the larger iSENSE community. Throughout the project, researchers from UML&#39;s Graduate School of Education are collecting formative data to inform system refinement and curriculum development and to answer questions about integration and use of cyber-enabled learning technologies in classrooms, and conducting a summative assessment to determine the project&#39;s impact on student learning and science teaching practice.Project deliverables include a set of iSENSE lesson plans, developed in close consultation with participating educators, together with several significant enhancements to the iSENSE data collection and visualization technology and a set of guidelines and justifications for those guidelines pertaining to developing data scientists and to integrating cyber-enabled learning technologies into classrooms. In particular, the project partners are developing data collection and visualization apps for Android and iOS mobile devices. On the iSENSE website, community-building features are being integrated into the system, giving users the ability to &#34;follow&#34; each other&#39;s system activity, in the manner of Twitter or Facebook. To foster a sense of community, students and teachers are encouraged to append comments to experiments, data sets, and saved visualizations. This enables them to ask questions relating to ongoing experiments,share resources, suggest further investigations, and critique one another&#39;s work.Because iSENSE incorporates many emerging cyberlearning technologies, including interactive data visualizations, on-line community-building features, and the use of mobile computing platforms, the project has broad potential implications for the cyberlearning field. The project team is investigating how interacting with cyberlearning technologies and collaborating on-line changes the way students think about scientific data and the nature of science. The team is also examining how cyberlearning resources, such as user-contributed web content, web-based software tools, and mobile computing platforms, can enhance science teaching practice. At the same time, the investigators seek to identify what resources are needed, in terms of technology, professional development, and curriculum, to effectively support incorporation of sophisticated learning technologies in support of science practice and learning in the classroom." amount_string="$1057625" award_instrument="Standard Grant" initial_amendment_date="Thu Sep 01 00:00:00 PDT 2011" latest_amendment_date="Thu Sep 01 00:00:00 PDT 2011" program_reference_codes="8842, 8045, 7444" simpl:id="10371010"><title>DIP: Collaborative Research: Transforming Science Learning with an Interactive Web Environment for Data Sharing and Visualization</title><clippings><text_clipping context="DIP: Collaborative Research: Transforming Science Learning with an Interactive Web Environment for Data Sharing and Visualization" text="DIP: Collaborative Research: Transforming Science Learning with an Interactive Web Environment for Data Sharing and Visualization"><source_doc><nsf_award simpl:ref="10371010"/></source_doc></text_clipping></clippings><investigators><investigator mm_name="authors" location="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/piSearch.do?SearchType=piSearch&amp;page=1&amp;QueryText=&amp;IncludeCOPI=true&amp;PIInstitution=&amp;PIState=&amp;PIZip=&amp;PICountry=&amp;Restriction=0&amp;Search=Search&amp;PIFirstName=Fred&amp;PILastName=Martin" email="fredm@cs.uml.edu" investigation_type="(Principal Investigator)" first_name="Fred" last_name="Martin"><title>Fred Martin</title></investigator><investigator mm_name="authors" location="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/piSearch.do?SearchType=piSearch&amp;page=1&amp;QueryText=&amp;IncludeCOPI=true&amp;PIInstitution=&amp;PIState=&amp;PIZip=&amp;PICountry=&amp;Restriction=0&amp;Search=Search&amp;PIFirstName=Michelle&amp;PILastName=Scribner-MacLean" investigation_type="(Co-Principal Investigator)" first_name="Michelle" last_name="Scribner-MacLean"><title>Michelle Scribner-MacLean</title></investigator></investigators><programs><grant_program mm_name="programs" location="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/afSearch.do?ExpDateOperator=&amp;PIFirstName=&amp;PICountry=&amp;Search=Search&amp;PIZip=&amp;Restriction=0&amp;StartDateFrom=&amp;StartDateOperator=&amp;page=4&amp;OriginalAwardDateFrom=&amp;ProgProgram=&amp;AwardAmount=&amp;ProgFoaCode=&amp;AwardNumberTo=&amp;ExpDateFrom=&amp;AwardNumberFrom=&amp;OriginalAwardDateTo=&amp;AwardInstrument=&amp;ExpDateTo=&amp;StartDateTo=&amp;ProgEleCode=8020&amp;PIInstitution=&amp;PILastName=&amp;OriginalAwardDateOperator=&amp;BooleanRef=false&amp;AwardNumberOperator=&amp;ProgOrganization=&amp;SearchType=afSearch&amp;BooleanElement=false&amp;ProgRefCode=&amp;QueryText=&amp;ProgOfficer=&amp;PIState="><title>Cyberlearning: Transforming Ed,NATIONAL SMETE DIGITAL LIBRARY</title><additional_locations><location>http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/afSearch.do?SearchType=afSearch&amp;page=4&amp;QueryText=&amp;PIFirstName=&amp;PILastName=&amp;PIInstitution=&amp;PIState=&amp;PIZip=&amp;PICountry=&amp;ProgOrganization=&amp;ProgOfficer=&amp;ProgEleCode=0&amp;BooleanElement=false&amp;ProgRefCode=&amp;BooleanRef=false&amp;ProgProgram=&amp;ProgFoaCode=&amp;OriginalAwardDateOperator=&amp;OriginalAwardDateFrom=&amp;OriginalAwardDateTo=&amp;StartDateOperator=&amp;StartDateFrom=&amp;StartDateTo=&amp;ExpDateOperator=&amp;ExpDateFrom=&amp;ExpDateTo=&amp;AwardNumberOperator=&amp;AwardNumberFrom=&amp;AwardNumberTo=&amp;AwardAmount=&amp;AwardInstrument=&amp;Restriction=0&amp;Search=Search</location></additional_locations></grant_program></programs><managers><manager mm_name="managers" location="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/afSearch.do?SearchType=afSearch&amp;page=4&amp;QueryText=&amp;PIFirstName=&amp;PILastName=&amp;PIInstitution=&amp;PIState=&amp;PIZip=&amp;PICountry=&amp;ProgOrganization=&amp;ProgEleCode=&amp;BooleanElement=false&amp;ProgRefCode=&amp;BooleanRef=false&amp;ProgProgram=&amp;ProgFoaCode=&amp;OriginalAwardDateOperator=&amp;OriginalAwardDateFrom=&amp;OriginalAwardDateTo=&amp;StartDateOperator=&amp;StartDateFrom=&amp;StartDateTo=&amp;ExpDateOperator=&amp;ExpDateFrom=&amp;ExpDateTo=&amp;AwardNumberOperator=&amp;AwardNumberFrom=&amp;AwardNumberTo=&amp;AwardAmount=&amp;AwardInstrument=&amp;Restriction=0&amp;Search=Search&amp;ProgOfficer=Janet+L.+Kolodner" affiliation="IIS Division of Information &amp; Intelligent Systems  CSE Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering"><title>Janet L.

SYSTEMS</title><description>This class contains interactive video distribution processes, systems, and&#10;elements thereof, which are characterized by point-to-multipoint&#10;system configurations, and which are used for the unidirectional&#10;distribution or delivery of motion video data resulting from interactions&#10;between systems operators (access or service providers) or&#10;users (subscribers) and systems elements. These&#10;systems include dedicated communications systems, such&#10;as television distribution systems, which primarily distribute&#10;or deliver motion video data in the manner indicated, but&#10;which may, in addition, provide a framework for&#10;further, diverse data communications or services in either&#10;unidirectional or bidirectional form. Typically, system&#10;operators interface with transmitter-side elements or users&#10;interface with receiver-side elements in order to facilitate, through&#10;interaction with such elements, the dynamic control of&#10;data processing or data flow at various points in the systems. This&#10;interaction is typically occasional or intermittent in nature.</description></patent_classification><image mm_name="google_patent_image" location="http://bks8.books.google.com/patents?id=kz_NAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;sig=ACfU3U3KH5aI9FWAEoN6HkNrmXZT4i7ejg"></image><amazon_list mm_name="amazon_wish_list" location="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/ref=wish_list"></amazon_list><amazon_list mm_name="amazon_bestseller_list" location="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/6"><title>Cookbooks, Food &amp; Wine</title><items><amazon_product mm_name="items" location="http://www.amazon.com/Wheat-Belly-Lose-Weight-Health/dp/1609611543/ref=zg_bs_6_1" price="$15.43" overall_rating="4.4 out of 5 stars"><title>Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health</title></amazon_product><amazon_product mm_name="items" location="http://www.amazon.com/Wheat-Belly-Weight-Health-ebook/dp/B00571F26Y/ref=zg_bs_6_2" price="$9.45" overall_rating="4.4 out of 5 stars"><title>Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back To Health</title></amazon_product><amazon_product mm_name="items" location="http://www.amazon.com/Fix-Freeze-Feast-Money-Saving-ebook/dp/B004A7YILQ/ref=zg_bs_6_3" price="$2.51" overall_rating="4.5 out of 5 stars"><title>Fix, Freeze, Feast: The Delicious, Money-Saving Way to Feed Your Family</title></amazon_product><amazon_product mm_name="items" location="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Paleo-Customized-Whole-Foods-Lifestyle/dp/1936608758/ref=zg_bs_6_4" price="$21.47" overall_rating="5.0 out of 5 stars"><title>Practical Paleo: A Customized Approach to Health and a Whole-Foods Lifestyle</title></amazon_product><amazon_product mm_name="items" location="http://www.amazon.com/Forks-Over-Knives-Cookbook-Plant-Based/dp/1615190619/ref=zg_bs_6_5" price="$11.37" overall_rating="3.4 out of 5 stars"><title>Forks Over Knives -

Its a fully decked board with a fair price compared to competitors. Gigabyte always wins in that category imo. Every gigabyte board I&#39;ve owned has had many Bios updates and this one is the same, just updated to Bios F11 and this thing runs like a champion. Battlefield 3 loves this chip runs incredible i love it.  Huge FPS jump in all of my games, huge increase in speed in everything, litterally everything. Also went ahead and threw 2 Vertex 4 SSds in raid 0 and im seeing blistering fast times in everything. All i can say is WOW. Top it off, anytimes you call Gigabyte, their techs are very helpfull and will take the time to make sure your taken care of, very cool and i appreciate that.

There is plenty of room between PCIe x16 slots and SATA ports do no get in the way of the graphics cards. Came with all the SATA 3.0 cables I needed as well as crossfire and SLI connections. Driver installation was simple. The board has a nice design and is not overly flashy.

I like ASUS&#39;s temperature monitoring software better, but there are other programs that can be downloaded for that. There was some bloatware bundled with the software as well.&#10;				Other Thoughts: Great LGA 2011 that does not cost an arm and a leg.

Similar to the tone of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, the first film of the two-part Twilight conclusion is heavy on romance, love, and turmoil but light on fight scenes and gruesome battles. The movie doesn&#39;t waste any time getting to the goods and opens with Bella and Edward&#39;s much-hyped wedding scene. It works--the vows are efficient and first-time franchise director Bill Condon (Dreamgirls) moves the party along quickly and amusingly with a well-edited toast scene and some surprisingly moving moments between Bella and her father, cast standout Billy Burke. The honeymoon plays as a slightly awkward soft-focus made-for-TV movie, with a lot of long moments spent staring in the mirror and some love scenes that feel at once overly intimate and completely passionless. It&#39;s a relief when Bella retches on a bite of chicken she&#39;s cooked herself and quickly concludes she&#39;s pregnant with a potentially demonic baby. From bliss to horror, the Cullens return to Forks, where Bella spends the second half of the movie wasting away and Edward and Jacob are aligned in their anger and frustration over her decision. Throw in some over-the-top scenes with Jacob and his pack--including a strange showdown where the wolves communicate in their canine form by having a passionate nonverbal fight in their minds (a plot point that works much better in print, it&#39;s portrayed in the film via aggressive voice-over)--and the film overshoots intensity and goes straight to silly. The birth scene is horrific, but not as gruesome as in the book, and by the end, Bella has of course survived, though is much altered. The final scene features a delightfully campy Michael Sheen as Volturi leader Aro and makes it clear that the action and fun in Breaking Dawn, Part 1 is ready to start. Fans will just have to wait until Part 2 to get it. --Kira Canny</description><clippings><image_clipping simpl:id="14962131"><source_doc><amazon_product simpl:ref="22525889"/></source_doc><media><image location="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YPtj%2BNFbL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" simpl:id="6888655"><clippings_this_is_in><image_clipping simpl:ref="14962131"/></clippings_this_is_in></image></media></image_clipping></clippings><image simpl:ref="6888655"/><reviews><product_review mm_name="reviews" description="381 of 449 people found the following review helpful&#10;      &#10;      &#10;        5.0 out of 5 stars &#10;        A very tasty story about love and death dancing with wolves, mixing happiness and sadness, despair and hope - and sex and blood!, November 16, 2011&#10;      &#10;      &#10;        By&#160;Maciej &#34;Darth Maciek&#34; (Darth Maciek is out there...)  - See all my reviews&#10;(TOP 1000 REVIEWER)&#10;&#160;&#160;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;      &#10;      &#10;        This review is from: The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part I (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)&#10;      &#10;&#10;I just saw &#34;Breaking Dawn&#34; part 1, and I was VERY impressed, even if as a man I am probably not the most typical fan of &#34;Twilight&#34; series. I rather liked all the &#34;Twilight&#34; movies until now and this one is, to my personnal taste, as good as the previous ones - and even in one aspect a little bit better, as Edward and Bella finally become lovers. Below, you will find a short description of what I believe are the best elements of this film, with very limited SPOILERS:1. Actors. All actors evolved as the serie continued and I believe they all got better with time. Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are both excellent, but - in my humble opinion - it is Kristen Stewart who in this movie shines the most. Quite a lot of people frequently criticized her actorship claiming that she simply can not play at all and has a very limited assortment of expressions in her tool box. But for me, after reading &#34;Twilight&#34; books, this is how the character of Bella should be. I can hardly picture her wide smiling with all her teeth bared or doing any other highly extraverted things like that. In fact I believe that either by design or by accident Kristen Stewart got the things right about this character - her minimalistic approach to facial expressions actually makes (for me) Bella very believable and also quite likeable. In this part of the story, Bella takes a more dynamic approach to life by taking her destiny firmly under control. She makes important decisions and takes extreme risks, stubbornly resisting the opposite advice of all her family and friends - all of that in a deceptively unassuming way... And Kristen Stewart acted in the movie exactly as I pictured Bella did it, when I read the books. A very good job!Other actors are also great, with Ashley Greene and Billy Burke being as usual the pillars - but amongst the supporting roles it is Nikki Reed who really gets the most praise from me. She has a much bigger role in this film and she is perfect in it! The one (little) disappointment is Jackson Rathbone, who changed comletely his haircut for this film and as a result his character, Jasper, seems much less impressive, which is a pity. He also seems to appear very little in the &#34;first line&#34;, almost as if the director preferred to hide him a little...2. Visual aspects. As usual, the images of state of Washington are great, but the tropical island where Bella and Edward spend their honey moon is also very pleasantly showed. Dark forests filled with (were)wolves are very much present here and they are a great background for the story.3. Music. As usual in those series, music and songs have been selected very carefully and with a great taste.4. The (were)wolf pack. The Quileute wolves are shown here even more and better than in the previous part. The scene of their war council, when they are all in the werewolf form, is absolutely great! The scene when Sam (the alpha male) asserts and confirms his power over the pack is excellent - as good as the description of Jacob&#39;s defiance and its consequences.5. The wedding. A very nice and moving scene with some humour elements, especially when the guests make speeches offering toasts. Emmett, Jessica and Bella&#39;s father give here a great show. In the same time Mike Newton obsesses on vampire bridesmaids from the Denali clan, to the point of drooling (and I TOTALLY understand him!). Bella&#39;s mum and, suprprise surprise, Rosalie (!) are also real treasures in wedding scenes.6. Quileute wolves vs. Cullen coven confrontation. This heartbreaking, tense and at moments violent conflict in which both sides are trapped against their will is a great moment in the Twilight saga - and its final resolution is even better! Finally it is true what the Beatles were singing - all you need is love! Babies help too...7. The fight for Bella&#39;s life, Renesmee&#39;s bloody birth and Bella&#39;s fate - excellent! Those were moments very difficult to film - but the challenge was met succesfully! Nothing more about it to avoid more spoilers, but I was very impressed!Conclusion: it is an excellent movie which I watched with great pleasure. My wife, who usually is a much harder person to please, loved it too and she is going to see it again with some girlfriends. And we will certainly both wait with great expectations for the &#34;Breaking dawn&#34; part 2. If it was done as well as that one, it will be certainly worth waiting one year to see it...&#10;      &#10;&#10;        Help other customers find the most helpful reviews&#160;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Was this review helpful to you?&#160;Yes&#10;No &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Report abuse&#10; | PermalinkComment&#160;Comments (24)" rating="5.0 out of 5 stars"></product_review><product_review mm_name="reviews" description="176 of 213 people found the following review helpful&#10;      &#10;      &#10;        5.0 out of 5 stars &#10;        Above and Beyond Expectations, November 21, 2011&#10;      &#10;      &#10;        By&#160;lilnhavoc  - See all my reviews&#10;      &#10;      &#10;        This review is from: The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part I (Special Edition) [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)&#10;      &#10;&#10;Being a huge fan of the books and a pretty big fan of the movies, I was blown away at what a great job they did with this movie installment. I loved the visual and audio parallels they drew between the original movie, Twilight, and this movie. For instance (Spoiler Alerts throughout): I loved how they played Flightless Bird during the wedding ceremony and the way the camera circled them kissing in the same manner the camera circled E &amp; B kissing at Prom at the very end of Twilight. It was a subtle, yet stunning way to visually tie the two movies together and really made more of an emotional impact than if they had just shot them straight on and plugged in a different song. That was genius. And that dress...gorgeous. Just as it was described in the book.I also loved that rather than having one continuous honeymoon &#34;consummation&#34; scene, they broke it up with Bella thinking about certain moments the next morning after looking in the mirror for the first time, where she&#39;s no longer a virgin. It was all done so tastefully. The way one&#39;s first time should be at that age. Not at some house party or in the back of some guy&#39;s car. For those who read the books and knew how Edward did everything he could to exhaust Bella with activities on their honeymoon so she&#39;d be too tired to &#34;try again&#34;, you have to admit that Bill Condon did such a great job showing you visually all the things they were doing without either character having to come out and say, I&#39;m/you&#39;re trying to exhaust you/me. And it was adorable with KS put on her little nightgown and leaned against the wall...I got married when I was 19 and I felt the exact same way when I put on lingerie for the first time and dreaded walking into the bedroom with my little gown on. I felt like a child playing dress-up, much like it came off Bella felt.I was also very impressed by the manner with which Bill Condon allowed us to see through the eyes of Jacob for the first time and hear what he hears with regard to the internal dialog between him and the pack. That scene where the wolves were running to the lumber yard and their voices echoed in Jacob&#39;s mind...that was so perfectly done. AND, I loved loved loved the way the Sam and Jacob had their battle for alpha. It was as if you, the person watching the movie, was in the mind of a wolf who is being forced into submission by it&#39;s Alpha. The CGI team did a great job because I forgot I was watching computer generated wolves and the intensity of the scene felt like I was there witnessing the true dynamic of a wolf pack.I thought the birth scene was beyond intense. The scene almost mirroring that as it&#39;s written in the book. I think they showed just the right amount of Bella&#39;s internal agony during her transformation. For those of us who read the books, to say she had a prolonged bout of suffering during her transformation would be an understatement. However, if they had shown more of that in the movie, it would have taken from the torture that Edward was going through thinking he had lost Bella, and Jacob&#39;s malevolence towards Renesmee prior to imprinting on her. That whole scene allowed for each character&#39;s state of mind to be both seen, visually, and felt, emotionally. Powerfully shot and brilliantly executed.I imagine the imprinting scene was a difficult one to translate from paper to screen. They did a great job in this as well. Not in any way cheesy, but sweet and breathless...if that makes any sense. The only thing I did not love about it was that the girl/teenager Jacob sees as an older Renesmee appeared to be CGI. They used an actual young girl to play the younger Renesmee, why not use a real person for the older Renesmee too? I&#39;m sure Hollywood has a few young actresses that would have auditioned for the part???I loved the fight between the wolves and the Cullens at the very end of the movie. In the books, you go from Jacob&#39;s perspective where he witnesses Bella&#39;s death and then walks into the living room to kill Renesmee, only to imprint on her. And then you go immediately back to Bella&#39;s perspective where she&#39;s riving in pain while she&#39;s transforming into a vampire. I feel Melissa Rosenburg had a stroke of brilliance when she decided to add this scene so that the audience could see what could have happened in the books, but did happen in the movie, during the time period between Jacob imprinting on Renesmee and Bella awakening for the first time as a vampire. Another unexpected and totally welcomed brilliant surprise of this movie.Another welcome surprise for me was while Bella was at the very end of her transformation. I thought it was a touching visual moment that just before her heart beat for the very last time, we witnessed Bella&#39;s memories in a somewhat reverse chronological order, ending with her very first human memory as a baby in the arms of her parents bouncing her in front of a mirror.But what was not a surprise and what I&#39;ve been telling my fellow twi-hards the past couple years is the very last scene of the movie. Once I heard they were splitting BD into two parts, I&#39;ve always maintained there&#39;s only one way to end part 1 with truly visual impact...and that is to witness Bella&#39;s subtle transformation from a broken human to a perfect vampire, surrounded by the Cullens, with the scene closing in on Bella&#39;s perfect facial features, zooming into her perfectly shut eyes...that suddenly open the most gorgeous crimson red....and straight to credits. I actually gave myself a little pat on the back for that one because so much of the movie exceeded my expectations of visual and audio creativity, and yet the last scene ending a certain way was something I was very adamant with my friends about, and sure enough that&#39;s how it ends. So maybe now I can revel in having an ounce of the vision that Bill Condon and Melissa Rosenburg possess...hey I&#39;ll take that ounce.Aside from the standout scenes I&#39;ve mentioned herein, I thought Kristen Stewart did her best portrayal of Bella yet. Her facial expressions alone are so real to each moment they&#39;re almost tangible. I&#39;ve enjoyed the work KS has done prior to the Twilight Saga, and I am so glad these movies have launched her career because I am certain she will be one of the great leading ladies of acting for many decades to come. So to all Twi-hards out there. This movie was amazing. A must see for those who loved the books and fans of the previous movies. I can&#39;t wait for it to come out on DVD so that I can add it to my Twilight Saga collection.&#10;      &#10;&#10;        Help other customers find the most helpful reviews&#160;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Was this review helpful to you?&#160;Yes&#10;No &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Report abuse&#10; | PermalinkComment&#160;Comments (14)" rating="5.0 out of 5 stars"></product_review><product_review mm_name="reviews" description="37 of 45 people found the following review helpful&#10;      &#10;      &#10;        1.0 out of 5 stars &#10;        Special Edition?

To help you get a great 3D experience, use the checklist below to ensure you have everything you need. 3D viewing requires:     A DisplayFirst, you&#39;ll need a 3D-ready display--whether it&#39;s a 3D HDTV, 3D projector, or 3D computer monitor. These displays have more processing power than standard 2D models for displaying 3D images in rapid succession.    A SourceYour display may be ready for 3D playback, but you&#39;ll still need a device to read 3D content. This can be a cable box with a subscription to a 3D channel, a 3D Blu-ray Disc player, or a PlayStation 3 system.    3D Content3D content--the actual entertainment, in other words--will be played back using the source mentioned above, whether it&#39;s a 3D broadcast from your cable provider, a 3D Blu-ray Disc, or a 3D video game.    3D GlassesFor now, the vast majority of 3D HDTVs require glasses for 3D viewing. Many use powered &#34;active shutter&#34; glasses, others polarized &#34;passive&#34; glasses. You&#39;ll need one pair per viewer, and they&#39;ll have to be compatible with your display, whether they&#39;re the same brand, or a pair of &#34;universal&#34; glasses designed to work across brands.    HDMI CableTo connect your source (such as a 3D Blu-ray Disc player) to your display, you&#39;ll need a high-speed HDMI cable. Cables with this designation feature bandwidth speeds up to 10.2 Gbps (gigabits per second), for carrying the 3D signal without any loss of quality.   If you want to get more information about 3D, shop our 3D products, watch videos, or interact with other customers, we invite you to visit 3D 101, our customer center about everything 3D.       Internet-Ready Devices  Internet-ready devices use your broadband connection to deliver dynamic content to your television, whether it&#39;s streaming video from Netflix, new music from Pandora, or a quick glance at today&#39;s weather forecast. Although there is overlap, each manufacturer offers a unique bundle of free or paid services, including streaming video and music, social networking apps, online photo galleries, news and financial updates, weather info, sports scores, and a variety of other smartphone-like applications. Manufacturers continue to add new content to their offerings, keeping customers current through firmware updates, and making a bit of research a prudent step in your buying decision. Learn more about Internet-ready devices and HDTVs, how they work, what services are offered by different manufacturers, and exactly what you&#39;ll need to get started at our Internet TV 101 customer center.

First off I notice major black light bleed out of the box &amp; even after tweaking the TV on my own until I found the right settings from a other users.What I really like about this tv is that my playstation 3 is synced with the tv. My tv come&#39;s on when the playstation is turned on and I can control my ps3 with my Samsung remote nice feature.  The tv is nice a thin not very heavy. The 2d to 3d conversion is total crap some stuff looks good but for the most part it&#39;s a BIG gimmick. Movies &amp; stuff filmed in 3D look amazing sometimes it&#39;s a hit &amp; miss. So far my favorite 3d movies are : ( Monsters Vs Aliens ) ( avatar ) ( Despicable me )  Resident evil looked like crap &amp; I really didn&#39;t like monster house. I am hoping the studios will improve 3D filming and make live action films pop out more. I tried some playstation 3 games in 3d I like the idea but WoW it really makes your eyes hurt after awhile.Setting up the tv was pretty easy I did found setting up the wireless on the Tv to be a real pain. I am pretty good with computers and wireless network it was still a pain. I have a netgear router and I was not able to link it with normal settings the tv kept saying my pass word was wrong password ended up doing the button method on my router and samsung tv. Right away the Tv found the router and no more issues.Now for the calibration settings that will make your set look amazing and reduce the famous Samsung clouding issue and black light bleeding which I couldn&#39;t stand until this ! Make sure you have a hdmi 1.4 cable I did notice a issue with my old hdmi cable and the 1.4 cable solved the slow lag, any cheap one will do as long as it&#39;s 1.4PICTUREPicture Mode MovieBacklight 8 (3D: 11)Contrast 92Brightness 48Sharpness 15Color 50Tint 50/50ADVANCEDBlack Tone OffDynamic Contrast OffShadow Detail 0Gamma 0Color Space CustomFlesh Tone 0Edge Enhancement OffMotion Lighting Off  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; THIS IS WHAT CAUSES CLOUDING I THINKxvYCC OffLed Motion Plus OffPICTURE OPTIONSColour Tone Warm2Digital Noise Filter OffMpeg Noise Filter OffHDMI Black level LowFilm Mode n/aMotion Plus Clear  R G BColour Space Red 58 2 0Colour Space Green 0 58 9Colour Space Blue 7 0 54Colour Space Yellow 48 53 7Colour Space Cyan 0 54 58Colour Space Magenta 56 4 45R-Offset 20G-Offset 24B-Offset 24R-Gain 19G-Gain 26B-Gain 25  R G B1 5 1 -22 2 0 -13 0 0 -14 -2 -3 -35 0 -2 -36 1 1 -47 2 3 08 1 2 09 -1 2 210 0 1 1Make sure you select each color in the color space and enter them like above.

After I changed the usage mode to &#39;home&#39;, it decreased considerably but was still noticeable.I visited some forums, websites, and some even advised to put pressure on the screen with my fingers (until I see the screen changing colors), etc, but nothing seemed to work.I decided to contact Samsung support and they advised me to change PICTURE MODE to &#39;STANDARD&#39; and adjust the &#39;BACKLIGHT&#39; to the value of &#39;7&#39;. The support guy/girl mentioned to leave this setting on for 3 weeks. After the three weeks, I should be able to change to any picture mode and to any value for the backlight. Finally, it was mentioned that if I did not see any changes, that a service ticket needs to be placed at this link (you will need to register your TV with Samsung): [...]I made the change today 4/15/2011 so I will wright another review within 3 weeks to let you know the end results.2) Sound stops working - I only have a PS3 and a DirecTV satellite box connected to the TV via HDMI cables (hight speed and 3D capable). I have noticed the TV produces no sound for like 1 second and then gradually comes back at a lower volume until it reaches the original volume. I have also noticed it only happens when the picture is set to &#39;STANDARD&#39; and have only noticed it when the source is the DirecTV box.I do not run the PS3 on standard mode so I can&#39;t compare, but I will do so and pay attention to the results.In summary, I have to wait for the 3 weeks picture test, and also test the sound using the PS3 source on standard mode.I know it&#39;s a hassle but for a TV that costs over $2000, I&#39;m willing to do whatever it takes to get a &#34;perfect&#34; picture and normal working sound (although you would not expect to do this since you are paying a lot of money)...And if you got this TV from Paul&#39;sTV (whether by Amazon&#39;s reseller program or directly from them) expect to pay 15% restocking fee and $100 shipping if you plan to return it.Hope this helps and please post any questions/comments you may have, and I will try to answer them as soon as possible.&#10;      &#10;&#10;        Help other customers find the most helpful reviews&#160;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Was this review helpful to you?&#160;Yes&#10;No &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Report abuse&#10; | PermalinkComment&#160;Comments (25)" rating="4.0 out of 5 stars"></product_review><product_review mm_name="reviews" description="99 of 110 people found the following review helpful&#10;      &#10;      &#10;        3.0 out of 5 stars &#10;        Great TV... If there is no flaw., March 31, 2011&#10;      &#10;      &#10;        By&#160;N.A (USA)  - See all my reviews&#10;      &#10;      &#10;        Amazon Verified Purchase(What&#39;s this?)&#10;      &#10;      &#10;        This review is from: Samsung UN46D7000 46-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV (Silver) [2011 MODEL] (Electronics)&#10;      &#10;&#10;I just got the TV in today, and from I experience so far is that this TV is amazing.Black level is great! One of the best I seen so far.Internet connection is great on the TV. Very useful for watching Netflix.The qwerty remotes that came with my TV is very useful for web browsing, but don&#39;t expect the browser to be like normal computer browser because it is very bad, slow, hard to navigate, and cumbersome.For gaming, in my opinion, there is no lag if you turn off the picture enhancements options, and also turning on the game mode. I would say the lag on the TV would be probably somewhere between 30-50ms.3D is great! I watched Shrek 3D, and it&#39;s just stunning. A major improvement from last year model. I probably will buy Tron 3D, and see it on the TV soon.Cons: HDMI input is located on the side. Clouding &amp; Flashlighting that can be seen in dark screen.Update: After 2 weeks of having the TV I noticed some flash lighting / clouding that can be seen in pitch black room. Not a big deal at first, but overtime I am starting to be annoyed by it. I am thinking of getting it exchange for higher end model. Therefore I am rating the TV 3/5 stars. If would be a solid 5 stars if there is no flaw.Update 2:  Returned my set and bought 46&#34; Sony HX929.&#10;      &#10;&#10;        Help other customers find the most helpful reviews&#160;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Was this review helpful to you?&#160;Yes&#10;No &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Report abuse&#10; | PermalinkComment&#160;Comments (15)" rating="3.0 out of 5 stars"></product_review><product_review mm_name="reviews" description="2115|R2V0KYB6O3SGU7;2115|R3ABPVAOMIXT6V;2115|R2WIQZZ1KDZG5J;"></product_review></reviews><bestseller_list_rank mm_name="bestseller_list_rank"></bestseller_list_rank><people_also_buy><amazon_product mm_name="people_also_buy" location="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN40ES6100-40-Inch-1080p-120Hz/dp/B0076M04QU/ref=pd_cp_e_0" price="$797.99"><title>Samsung UN40ES6100 40-Inch 1080p 120Hz Slim LED HDTV (Black)</title></amazon_product><amazon_product mm_name="people_also_buy" location="http://www.amazon.com/Mediabridge-Ultra-Series-Certified-Available/dp/B0019EHU8G/ref=pd_cp_e_1" price="$9.99"><title>Mediabridge Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet - (6 Feet) - Category 2 Certified - Supports 3D &amp; Audio Return Channel [Latest HDMI Version Available]</title></amazon_product><amazon_product mm_name="people_also_buy" location="http://www.amazon.com/LG-47LM7600-47-Inch-LED-LCD-Glasses/dp/B006ZH0KVG/ref=pd_cp_e_2"><title>LG Cinema Screen 47LM7600 47-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 240Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glasses</title></amazon_product><amazon_product mm_name="people_also_buy" location="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN46ES6500-46-Inch-1080p-120Hz/dp/B007B9PM4W/ref=pd_cp_e_3" price="$1,097.99"><title>Samsung UN46ES6500 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz 3D Slim LED HDTV (Black)</title></amazon_product></people_also_buy></amazon_product><amazon_product location="http://www.amazon.com/Deathly-Hallows-Movie-Only-Edition-UltraViolet/dp/B005O30Y5Y" price="$12.80" overall_rating="3.2 out of 5 stars" model="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kHnaW--eL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" reviews_location="http://www.amazon.com/Deathly-Hallows-Movie-Only-Edition-UltraViolet/product-reviews/B005O30Y5Y/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_img?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1" simpl:id="12373914"><title>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (Movie-Only Edition + UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]</title><description>The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is the film all Harry Potter fans have waited 10 years to see, and the good news is that it&#39;s worth the hype--visually stunning, action packed, faithful to the book, and mature not just in its themes and emotion but in the acting by its cast, some of whom had spent half their lives making Harry Potter movies. Part 2 cuts right to the chase: Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has stolen the Elder Wand, one of the three objects required to give someone power over death (a.k.a. the Deathly Hallows), with the intent to hunt and kill Harry. Meanwhile, Harry&#39;s quest to destroy the rest of the Horcruxes (each containing a bit of Voldemort&#39;s soul) leads him first to a thrilling (and hilarious--love that Polyjuice Potion!) trip to Gringotts Bank, then back to Hogwarts, where a spectacular battle pitting the young students and professors (a showcase of the British thesps who have stolen every scene of the series: Maggie Smith&#39;s McGonagall, Jim Broadbent&#39;s Slughorn, David Thewlis&#39;s Lupin) against a dark army of Dementors, ogres, and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter, with far less crazy eyes to make this round). As predicted all throughout the saga, Harry also has his final showdown with Voldemort--neither can live while the other survives--though the physics of that predicament might need a set of crib notes to explain. But while each installment has become progressively grimmer, this finale is the most balanced between light and dark (the dark is quite dark--several familiar characters die, with one significant death particularly grisly); the humor is sprinkled in at the most welcome times, thanks to the deft adaptation by Steve Kloves (who scribed all but one of the films from J.K. Rowling&#39;s books) and direction by four-time Potter director David Yates. The climactic kiss between Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), capping off a decade of romantic tension, is perfectly tuned to their idiosyncratic relationship, and Daniel Radcliffe has, over the last decade, certainly proven he was the right kid for the job all along. As Prof. Snape, the most perfect of casting choices in the best-cast franchise of all time, Alan Rickman breaks your heart. Only the epilogue (and the lack of chemistry between Harry and love Ginny Weasley, barely present here) stand a little shaky, but no matter: the most lucrative franchise in movie history to date has just reached its conclusion, and it&#39;s done so without losing its soul. --Ellen A.

I was not really expecting a response back and was amazed, as their Customer Service department contacted me almost immediately and requested that I provide them with the Reference Code (to verify my purchase of the movie) and they would send me an activation code which will allow me to redeem an electronic version of the movie on iTunes.I sent them the code and they responded almost immediately with a reference code.  I entered the code on iTunes and was able to redeem the movie on iTunes and watch it on my iPad.I hope that this information is useful to other buyers of the movie.&#10;      &#10;&#10;        Help other customers find the most helpful reviews&#160;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Was this review helpful to you?&#160;Yes&#10;No &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Report abuse&#10; | PermalinkComment&#160;Comments (34)" rating="5.0 out of 5 stars"></product_review><product_review mm_name="reviews" description="524 of 597 people found the following review helpful&#10;      &#10;      &#10;        3.0 out of 5 stars &#10;        UK version includes 3D Blu-ray and real Digital Copy, October 28, 2011&#10;      &#10;      &#10;        By&#160;NewUser &#34;New&#34; (California)  - See all my reviews&#10;      &#10;      &#10;        This review is from: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (Blu-ray/DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy) (Blu-ray)&#10;      &#10;&#10;I&#39;m not buying the U.S. version, the region free UK release will include the Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD and a real Digital Copy.

OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: To present preliminary results of PLIF using a compressive bone graft with allograft and pedicle screw fixation in the lumbar pyogenic discitis.METHODS: Fifteen patients who had lumbar pyogenic discitis were treated by posterior approach from May 2004 to July 2008. The mean follow-up duration was 27.2 &#177; 18.68 months. The standing radiographs of the lumbar spine and clinical results were compared and analyzed in order to assess the bony union, the changes in the distance between the two vertebral bodies and the changes in the lordotic angle formed between the fused bodies immediately after surgery and at the final follow-up.RESULTS: Fifteen solid unions at an average of 15.2 &#177; 3.5 weeks after operation. The mean preoperative lordotic angle of the affected segments was 14.3 &#177; 15.1&#176;, compared to 20.3 &#177; 12.3&#176; after surgery and 19.8 &#177; 15.2&#176; at last follow-up. For the functional result according to the Kirkaldy-Willis criteria, the outcome was excellent in 9, good in 5, fair in 1, and there were no poor cases. The average visual analogue scale score was decreased from 7.4 before surgery to 3.4 at 2 weeks postoperative.CONCLUSIONS: The main advantage in the procedure of PLIF using compressive bone graft with allograft and post instrumentation is early ambulation. We believe that this is another good procedure for patients with poor general condition because a further autograft bone harvest is not required.</abstract><authors><author mm_name="authors"><title>An KC</title></author><author mm_name="authors"><title>Kim JY</title></author><author mm_name="authors"><title>Kim TH</title></author><author mm_name="authors"><title>Kim JS</title></author><author mm_name="authors"><title>Park DH</title></author><author mm_name="authors"><title>Kim JG</title></author><author mm_name="authors"><title>Sung TW</title></author></authors></pubmed_article><wikipedia_page location="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system" simpl:id="10868722"><title>Type system</title><description>A type system associates a type with each computed value.
